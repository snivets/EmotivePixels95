I was trying to make up for past sins by actually completing the game even though I wasn't having fun, but also, I wanted to be positive, so I quit early. I'm very thankful we had 3 of us for this one; the difference in perspectives between us is useful for games like this. I think it was a pretty interesting discussion!"
