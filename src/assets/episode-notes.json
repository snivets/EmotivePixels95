I was trying to make up for past sins by actually completing the game even though I wasn't having fun, but also, I wanted to be positive, so I quit early. I'm very thankful we had 3 of us for this one; the difference in perspectives between us is useful for games like this. I think it was a pretty interesting discussion!"

    "notes": "Ah, here it is, the first episode. I haven't gone back to fully listen to this in a long time, but I've done my fair share of editing these early episodes in 2020 when we got back to releasing them so I feel vaguely like I have a decent idea. These were the most fun to make, especially for the time, but they stand up the least as episodes of a podcast I can imagine myself listening to. It's hard because sometimes that makes me wonder if rebranding or relaunching would do us better, delisting these as some future Patreon graveyard, but then it's like, our listenership is small anyway, so what exactly do I gain by consigning my own work to the graveyard like that? They were fun to make and I'm sure they're fun to listen to for someone out there, and they're part of the arc of the art.<br />Anyway though, we had to start here; it's one of the two main games our dear friend Alberto has played and loved. When you know Alberto, you can't turn down his joy - it's infectious - even if we do beat up on him a bit in these early episodes."
