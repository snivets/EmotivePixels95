export const ABOUT_PODCAST = "Hi! You've reached the website for Emotive Pixels, a videogame podcast hosted by a group of friends that originally met around a table in Seattle to casually banter about games we played. These days, we're a little more focused, and we have a bit more specific goals in how we cover games, so there's a fair difference between early episodes (labeled 'Season 1', up through episode 55) and the current seasons. You can find out about the hosts here, browse and listen to our episodes, and even get some behind-the-scenes insight on fun facts about each show.";

export const NATE_BIO = "Nate is a loud tall blonde with many passions, most of them boiling down to either architecture, human cultures, or independent music and games. Given that I wrote this I can say that honestly my gaming role model is Chris Plante. Sometimes I wonder if I like books more than games.";
export const CRAIG_BIO = "Craig is a Coloradan in all senses of the term, except that he has a high-functioning job and is in touch with his emotions. He loves all things Sony, and is deeply immersed in all the happenings of the industry. Will someone get this guy a studio executive job already?!";
export const WILL_BIO = "Will is a genius, the biggest and boldest gamer among us (and by that I mean he could complete Factorio the quickest and loves FTL the most), and shows up whenever he feels like it. Unfortunately, we often disappoint him with our choice of games - either too obscure, or insufficiently GAMEY. He loves systems, JRPGs, and Brandon Sanderson. He resides in Seattle, the original hub of the podcast, and in fact lived for a time above the Uwajimaya in the very room where the early episodes were recorded.";
export const PAULY_BIO = "Pauly is the friendly likeable one of the lot, a charming man from New England who loves music, plays music, and is picking up DJing. He likes many kinds of games in no particular pattern that I can discern, but suffice it to say he has great taste. He lives in Syracuse, NY.";
