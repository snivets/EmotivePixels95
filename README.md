# Emotive Pixels '95
This is a silly app that serves as an episode browser for my little videogames podcast that I make with some of my friends. It's a Vite app that has been my playground for learning React - I'm an Angular developer previously (and at heart?).

Functionally, it's an SPA that lets you browse our episodes and also access some behind-the-scenes text that I wrote about some of the episodes. There's also modals for getting to know each of the members, and some other features meant as a companion piece. I'm absolutely positive the endstate of this project is adding playback support with full-blown Milkdrop integration ðŸ˜‹

It's a playground where I can introduce some slightly-overwrought features like React95, and a little bit of state management. If you look through the commit history, you'll see the full journey of someone who is going from zero to hero!
